# RSS-Feed-Text-Analyzer
The repository contains a Python script that automates the process of extracting articles from RSS feeds, preprocessing the text, visualizing the most frequent words and bigrams using word clouds, and analyzing the content using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to find the most relevant bigrams in the text. The script uses various libraries like feedparser, BeautifulSoup, nltk, wordcloud, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to handle different aspects of the process, from data extraction and cleaning to visualization and analysis.
